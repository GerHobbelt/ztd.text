	|unfinished_warning|

This is a section that contains troubleshooting, typical compilation errors, and FAQs/fixes for common problems. It is meant to be mostly for linking to answers for repeated existing problems when using the library. It is barren at the moment, but hopefully will be filled out more as the library's lifetime increases. If you would like to see something here, please do not hesitate to `file an issue at the repository <https://github.com/soasis/text>`_.
