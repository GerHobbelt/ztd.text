Title: "All Unicode Scalar Values Conversion - Internals - UTF-32 to UTF-16 (Well-Formed, with Init)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-32 data to UTF-16 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 11 groups, and 1 data label (real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- cuneicode_registry_single_from_bulk is 11th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "2.56940096666568" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_single_from_bulk_unbounded is 10th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
  Measures to a mean of "1.5927809318493087" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- iconv is 9th. Described as: "Measures the libiconv (GNU version) encoding library, using its POSIX-compliant function call "iconv".".
  Measures to a mean of "0.47680614069050675" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- icu_ucnv_convertEx is 8th. Described as: "Measures the ICU library and its conversion routines when routed through 2 generic "UConverter" converter objects.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.46888773154203783" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- standard_cpp is 7th. Described as: "Measures the deprecated std::codecvt_* functionality present in the C++ standard library.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.4207001158918206" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry is 6th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.11870975226154856" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unchecked is 5th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone (without checking for the validity of the input).".
  Measures to a mean of "0.1120849207292546" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unchecked_unbounded is 4th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size, and without checking input validity).".
  Measures to a mean of "0.10345341927709166" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unbounded is 3rd. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
  Measures to a mean of "0.10009256624989575" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- memcpy is 2nd. Described as: "Measures just copying the correct, expected data to the desired output. This is useful as a reflection of how fast it could potentially be.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.02590391951928871" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "1.3266612465182939e-17" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
