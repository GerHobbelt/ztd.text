Title: "C Character Set - UTF-32 to UTF-8 (Well-Formed, with Init)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-32 data to UTF-8 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 15 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- cuneicode_registry_single_from_bulk is 15th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "127.7808982148556" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unchecked_unbounded is 14th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size, and without checking input validity).".
