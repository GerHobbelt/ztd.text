Title: "All Unicode Scalar Values - UTF-16 to UTF-8 (Well-Formed, with Init)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-16 data to UTF-8 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 16 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- cuneicode_registry_single_from_bulk is 16th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "4.857249363664199" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_single_from_bulk_unbounded is 15th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
