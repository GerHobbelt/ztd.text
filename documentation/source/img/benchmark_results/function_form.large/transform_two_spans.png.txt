Title: "All Unicode Scalar Values - Transform 2 Spans, Return Error Information". Description: "Attempting to measure how the form of a function (pointers vs. sizes) changes affects repetitive use."

There are 7 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- err_ptrptr_ptr_ptrptr_ptr is 7th. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion using output pointers for the data and its size and returning an error code.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.506171112007772" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- err_ptrptr_ptrsize_ptrptr_ptrsize is 6th. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion using output pointers for the data and its size.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.4995619799974763" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- structsize_ptr_ptr_ptr_ptr is 5th. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion returning a structure which contains the error code with a pointer/size pair representing input and output, and the function input takes a list of pointers representing the beginning and end of the input and output spans.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.34524183462068037" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- structptr_ptr_size_ptr_size is 4th. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion returning a structure which contains the error code with a pointer/pointer pair representing input and output, and the function input takes a two pointer/size pairs representing the input and output spans.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.3187520229819876" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- structptr_ptr_ptr_ptr_ptr is 3rd. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion returning a structure which contains the error code with a pointer/pointer pair representing input and output, and the function input takes a list of pointers representing the beginning and end of the input and output spans.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.31622632589512384" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- structsize_ptr_size_ptr_size is 2nd. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion returning a structure which contains the error code with a pointer/size pair representing input and output, and the function input takes a two pointer/size pairs representing the input and output spans.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.3159241229235964" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "1.5733317316820226e-17" milliseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
