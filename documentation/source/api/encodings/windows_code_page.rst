Windows Code Page
=================

``WideCharToMultiByte`` and ``MultiByteToWideChar`` on Windows platforms has a multitude of encodings with a particular set of quirks. Therefore, on Windows platforms, it may be advantageous to use this over the regular :cpp:class:`execution_encoding_t` type or :cpp:var:`execution_encoding` object. The constructor takes a raw ``int32_t`` whose sole purpose is to be one of the known `Code Page Identifiers`_ that Microsoft supplies on its platforms.

.. warning::

	This type is inefficient due to the poor design of the ``WideCharToMultiByte``/``MultiByteToWideChar`` functions. While this will allow users to achieve parity, if the user knows their encoding ahead of time and can provide either their own encoding object or :doc:`one of the encoding types provided by this library </encodings>`, it is highly preferred over this methodology.

.. warning::

	For certain distributions, specific language packs may need to be installed in order to use certain conversions tied to specific `Code Page Identifiers`_.
